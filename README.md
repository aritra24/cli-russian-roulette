# Russian Roulette CLI
A CLI based Russian roulette implemented in C. On success, the CLI executes a script to delete everthing. And by everything, we literally mean everything on the disk. User caution is advised.

## Usage
1. Uncomment the call to the system function on line 88.
2. Compile using make

   ``make ``
3. Run using 

	``sudo ./roulette``

*NOTE*: Sudo access is required for execution.

*Disclaimer*: The tool is only meant to kill some time when you are bored and happen to have a useless server lying around. The developers are in no way responsible for any damages that may occur due to unwise usage of the tool.
